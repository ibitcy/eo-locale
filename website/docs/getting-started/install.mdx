**`eo-locale`** can be used in React, Preact, and React Native
You can install the package with NPM or Yarn.

> Note: React 16.8+ is required for Hooks.

## React

### with NPM

```sh
npm i @eo-locale/react --save
```

### with Yarn

```sh
yarn add @eo-locale/react
```

## Preact

### with NPM

```sh
npm i @eo-locale/preact --save
```

### with Yarn

```sh
yarn add @eo-locale/preact
```

## React Native

### with NPM

```sh
npm i @eo-locale/react-native --save
```

### with Yarn

```sh
yarn add @eo-locale/react-native
```

### Setting up

React Native has "JavaScript Core" (JSC) to run JavaScript codes in Android.
By default, the JSC does not support libraries that manage internationalization.
To use `eo-locale`, you need to change new JSC distribution and rebuild your project.

#### In React Native 0.60 or newer

Change value of `jscFlavor` in file `android/app/build.gradle` to `org.webkit:android-jsc-intl:+`.

```
/**
 * The preferred build flavor of JavaScriptCore.
 *
 * For example, to use the international variant, you can use:
 * `def jscFlavor = 'org.webkit:android-jsc-intl:+'`
 *
 * The international variant includes ICU i18n library and necessary data
 * allowing to use e.g. `Date.toLocaleString` and `String.localeCompare` that
 * give correct results when using with locales other than en-US.  Note that
 * this variant is about 6MiB larger per architecture than default.
 */
def jscFlavor = 'org.webkit:android-jsc-intl:+'
```

And rebuild your project, then you can use `eo-locale` everywhere in your application!

#### In React Native 0.59

First, you need to install an NPM dependency named `jsc-android` by adding it to the `dependencies` section in your `package.json`,
and run `npm install` or `yarn install`.

```json
"dependencies": {
    "jsc-android": "241213.X.Y",
    ...
}
```

(`X` and `Y` is a minor and patch version. Check on the [JSC repository](https://github.com/react-native-community/jsc-android-buildscripts))

Update 3 sections in file `android/app/build.gradle`.

- **`dependencies`**

  Add `implementation "org.webkit:android-jsc-intl:r241213"` at first of the section.

  ```
  dependencies {
      implementation "org.webkit:android-jsc-intl:r241213"
      implementation fileTree(dir: "libs", include: ["*.jar"])
      ...
  }
  ```

- **`android`**

  Add `packagingOptions` to this section as follow:

  ```
  android {
      ...
      packagingOptions {
          pickFirst '**/libjsc.so'
          pickFirst '**/libc++_shared.so'
      }
  }
  ```

- **`jscFlavor`**

  Change `jscFlavor` to `org.webkit:android-jsc-intl:+`.

#### In React Native 0.58 or below

You can find this information on the [JSC repository](https://github.com/react-native-community/jsc-android-buildscripts).
